Snapdragon™ Game Studios developed Snapdragon™ Game Super Resolution (Snapdragon™ GSR or SGSR), 
which integrates upscaling and sharpening in one single GPU shader pass.
 
Our solution provides an efficient solution for games to draw 2D UI at device resolution for better visual quality, 
while rendering the 3D scene at a lower resolution for performance and power savings.

The technique has visual quality on par with other spatial upscaling techniques while being highly optimized for Adreno™ GPU hardware.
